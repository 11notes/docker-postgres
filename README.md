PostgreSQL, as simple and secure as it gets

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [16](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/postgres/tags?name=16)
* [latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/postgres/tags?name=latest)

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run postgres as postgres with the database postgres and the password you set initially. Why so simple? Because 99.9% of all containers that need postgres, are happy with the default settings, no different dbname, different dbuser, whatever needed. It also adds a simple `backup` command to backup the entire database. This command can be executed on a schedule by using [11notes/cron]/(https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/cron).

This image contains [cmd-socket](https://github.com/11notes/go-cmd-socket) exposed via ```/run/cmd/.sock```, you can mount it to other images to issue commands on this image (like backup schedule) via curl.
